# smart-fuel-control-system-for-boiler-efficiency
An embedded system project for optimizing boiler efficiency using real-time combustion monitoring.
# ðŸ”¥ Smart Fuel Control System for Boiler Efficiency

This project uses a **Raspberry Pi Pico** running **MicroPython** to optimize combustion efficiency in boilers by controlling air supply based on the composition of coal.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Real-time input of coal composition.
- Calculates:
  - Oxygen required
  - Minimum air needed
  - Flue gas produced
  - Excess air
- Motorized control of airflow using L298N driver
- LCD display of combustion data
- LED indication for excess or required oxygen

---

## ðŸ§  Formulae Used

- `Oxygen = (8/3 * C) + (8 * Hâ‚‚) + S - Oâ‚‚`
- `Minimum Air = (100/23) * Oxygen`
- `Flue Gas = (11/3 * C) + (9 * Hâ‚‚) + (2 * S) + N`
